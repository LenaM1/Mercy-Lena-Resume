            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>As a graduate I have acquired knowledge and skills in collaboration with others. I am able to efficiently
            work with others to achieve set goals and objectives. Trained as an environmentalist and gifted in 
            communication especially public speaking, I seek to influence the environment around me through
            speech. Story-telling to be specific that I will actively influence how people tell stories and not just stories
            but stories that sell and impact. I commit to changing the community around me through stories that
            impact.</p>
